Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application starter kit for Laravel and provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application. Jetstream provides the implementation for your application's login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management features.
